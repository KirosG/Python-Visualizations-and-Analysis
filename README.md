# Python-Visualizations

This is a Python 3.6 Jupyter notebook, to install I recommend  https://www.anaconda.com/download/. 

There are dependies with geopandas, look http://geopandas.org/install.html to install, I used the condas command to install it but it may vary depending on the computer

The data files are kept in a zipped for and can be accessed without unzipping them by using geopandas.
